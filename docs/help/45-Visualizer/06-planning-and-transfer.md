# Planning a Rig, and Moving It

The ToskLight Viz Editor is a rig-planning window: the same patch sheet the desk uses, over a
show file rather than over a running desk. A rig planned there and a show running on a desk are
the same rig, and neither side should have to go looking for a file to get from one to the other.

## Load from Desk

When a ToskLight desk with a show open is on the same network, the editor's file bar gains a
**Load from Desk** button naming that desk and the show it is running. Pressing it takes a copy of
that show, keeps it beside the editor's own documents, and opens it. Two desks are two buttons,
each naming its own machine; hovering one shows the address it was found at.

What arrives is a copy. Patching it here does not reach the desk, and the desk does not know the
copy exists. To send work back, use **Load from Visualizer** in the desk's **Load Show** menu.

## Load from Visualizer

The desk's **Load Show** menu offers the document this editor has open, in the same way and with
the same result: the desk imports it as an ordinary show and opens it. Only an editor that
actually has a document open is offered — an editor with nothing open is on the network, and says
so, but there is nothing to load from it.

## What the two sides publish

Each application announces itself on the local network, over the same standard service discovery
printers and audio interfaces use, saying which of the two it is and what it currently holds. It
publishes nothing else: no show content, no programming, no desk state. The name follows the
machine, so a rig with two editors is two entries an operator can tell apart.

The document served to the network is read-only, and it is the same read-only document the
Visualizer itself reads. There is no route into the editor that changes anything from outside it.

## When there is nothing to offer

Discovery is a convenience and never a requirement. A network with no discovery, a firewall that
blocks it, or a machine where the responder will not start costs the button and nothing else:
both applications start, run, and open files exactly as they did before. A show file opened
through **Open** or **Show from USB** is the same show file either button would have fetched.
